# Airplane-Crash-Severity-Prediction-Using-ML-ANN

Fatalities and severe injuries caused due to vehicle accidents have been among the most unpredictable happenings and elusive cases that might occur anywhere in the world. Aviation is a subset of these accident types that are far more difficult to investigate and are typically left off as speculations or mysteries in this project. Regarding the topic, this research focuses on previous aircraft accidents and trains a few algorithms to determine which one can accurately forecast the severity of the provided incidents, so that it can be used to anticipate real-life accident circumstances in the future. An implementation of a few well-known prediction algorithms will be taken forward in forecasting the severity of Airplane Accidents, with details gathered from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) accidents and incidents data from Kaggle. Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Nave Bayes are the algorithms or methodologies that will be used, tested, and compared. The dataset includes parameters recorded during the incident, such as cabin temperature, turbulence, the number of safety complaints received prior to the accident, the number of days since the last inspection performed prior to the incident, an estimate of the pilot's control given the various factors at play, and so on. This research and implementation can also help in predicting the most likely causes of that particular severity level of an accident, allowing us to work on these issues to reduce accident severities or uncertainty in the aviation sector.
